# School_District_Analysis

Project Overview

We were given the following tasks to complete for an analysis of test scores and how that relate to school size, school type, and budgets.
    
    1. Calculate the number of students that passed math and reading tests from each school.
    2. From above, calculate the percentage of students that passed math and reading, respectively.
    3. Calculate the overall percentage of students who passed both tests according to each school.
    4. Determine the numbers and percentages of students that passed both tests based on their school size.
    5. Determine the numbers and percentages of students that passed both tests based on their school type.
    6. Determine the numbers and percentages of students that passed both tests based on the budget each student receives by school.
    
Results

Afterwards, we were instructed to remove all test scores of 9th grade students from Thomas High School due to suspicions of academic dishonesty.

    - District summary and school summary are minimally affected after the changes, average math score, average reading score, % passing math, % passing reading, and overall % passing all decreased by .1 compared to the original summaries, not enough to affect the overall data.
    - Besides the missing data for 9th grade, Thomas High School's performance remains relatively unchanged compared to other schools.
    -Replacing the ninth-grade scores have not affected the scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type.In math and reading scores by grade, the data for Thomas High School remains undefined.

Summary

    1. The number of students at Thomas High School who passed math increased when calculating against total number of Thomas High students.
    2. The number of students at Thomas High School who passed reading increased when calculating against total number of Thomas High students.
    3. The percentage of students at Thomas High School who passed math increased when calculating against total number of Thomas High students.
    4. The percentage of students at Thomas High School who passed reading increased when calculating against total number of Thomas High students.
    5. The overall percentage of students at Thomas High School who passed math and reading increased when calculating against total number of Thomas High students.
